# 🎯 IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required

## Next Steps to Complete FlowOps Setup

Your FlowOps application is **built and running**, but you need to set up the database tables in Supabase before you can use it.

### Step 1: Set Up Database Tables

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   Go to: https://tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr.supabase.co/project/tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr/sql/new

2. **Copy and Run the SQL Schema**:
   - Open the file `supabase-schema.sql` in this project
   - Copy ALL the contents
   - Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

3. **Verify Tables Created**:
   - Go to Table Editor: https://tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr.supabase.co/project/tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr/editor
   - You should see these tables:
     - workspaces
     - workspace_members  
     - projects
     - tasks
     - subtasks
     - time_entries
     - channels
     - messages
     - meetings
     - docs
     - notifications
     - activity_logs

### Step 2: Test the Application

Once the database tables are created:

1. **Open the App**: https://team-productivity.preview.emergentagent.com

2. **Sign Up**: Create a new account
   - Use a valid email address
   - Choose a strong password
   - Enter your name

3. **Create a Project**: 
   - Click "Projects" in the sidebar
   - Click "New Project"
   - Enter project name and description

4. **Create a Task**:
   - Click "Tasks" in the sidebar
   - Click "New Task"
   - Fill in task details
   - Select the project you created

5. **Track Time**:
   - Click "Start" button on a task
   - Watch the timer run in the top bar
   - Click "Stop" to log the time
   - View logged time in "Time Tracking" page

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Check these features:
- ✅ User signup and login

- ✅ Create tasks
- ✅ Start/stop timer on tasks
- ✅ View time tracking statistics
- ✅ Dashboard shows task and time overview
- ✅ Update task status (To Do → In Progress → Completed)

## 🚨 If You Get Errors

### "relation 'workspaces' does not exist"
**Solution**: You haven't run the SQL schema yet. Go to Step 1 above.

### "No workspace found"
**Solution**: 
1. The workspace should be created automatically on signup
2. Check that the `workspaces` and `workspace_members` tables exist
3. Try signing up again with a new email

### "Unauthorized" errors
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check that Row Level Security policies were created (they're in the SQL schema)
3. Try logging out and logging back in

### Can't see any data
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you've created at least one project first
2. Then create tasks and assign them to that project
3. Check browser console for any errors
