## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

You need to create the database tables in your Supabase account:

1. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor: https://tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr.supabase.co/project/tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr/sql

2. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` and run it in the SQL Editor

3. This will create all necessary tables:
   - workspaces
   - workspace_members
   - projects
   - tasks
   - subtasks
   - time_entries
   - channels
   - messages
   - meetings
   - docs
   - notifications
   - activity_logs

4. The script also sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data security

### 2. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are already configured in `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://tsnahgabddfpcxuvcxvr.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /app
